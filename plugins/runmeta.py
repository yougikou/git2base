Sample Run Metadata Plugin for Git2Base

How itâ€™s discovered:
- Place this file as `plugins/runmeta.py` next to the executable (or repository root when running from source).
- No env var needed. The loader auto-discovers `plugins/runmeta.py` and looks for one of:
  - `producer` (an object with project_metadata/run_metadata)
  - `make()` (a factory returning such an object)
  - Top-level functions `project_metadata(...)` and `run_metadata(...)`

Implementing the interface:
- project_metadata(...)-> dict: returns fields to merge into project.json
- run_metadata(...)-> dict: returns fields to merge into run.json

Reserved fields are managed by core and will be ignored if returned:
- project.json: schema_version, id, latest_run, updated_at, runs
- run.json: schema_version, project_id, run_id, run_type, scope_type, scope_key, started_at
